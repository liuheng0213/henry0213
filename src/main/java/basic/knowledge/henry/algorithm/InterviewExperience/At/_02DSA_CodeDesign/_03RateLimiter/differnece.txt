Fixed window and sliding window rate limiters differ in how they track requests over time.
Fixed windows divide time into fixed intervals and count requests within each interval,
while sliding windows maintain a moving window that tracks requests over a more recent period.
Sliding windows are more flexible and can handle spikes in traffic better,
