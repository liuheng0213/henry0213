每次操作记得更新成员变量

CopyOnWriteArrayList

ConcurrentLinkedQueue

PriorityBlockingQueue

ConcurrentHashMap


* When you have multiple shared mutable variables that must be updated together atomically.
 *
 * When operations are complex and can’t be handled by atomic variables alone.
 *
 * When you need to protect compound actions (read-modify-write sequences) on multiple fields.


 the highest priority to make code thread safe is , find the shared variable firstly
