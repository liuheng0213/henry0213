Thanks. For DSA and code design rounds,
I focussed mainly on the common questions that atlassian asks.
You can consolidate a list by going through various discussions we have in leetcode.
For System design I took Arpit's masterclass which helped me.
 For P50, they also focus on what impact you made in your previous organisations,
\so you can get those points ready.


Looking all the leetcode and glassdoor post I prepared following systems
1.Tag management

web scaper similar to web craweler
Lol Here is the question: find top confluence feed. You have to find feed based on likes share and view.
